    "text": "Topic of Interest and motivations\nConventional wisdom holds that right-wingers should be hawkish and are supposed to tend to support a more aggressive foreign policy compared to liberals, however, this does not seem to be the case for American Republicans in the Russia’s invasion of Ukraine scenario, according to the following accounts. 19 GOP lawmakers urged Biden to stop sending “unrestrained” aid and weapons to Ukraine ( Oshin 2023), and Donald Trump has also claimed to try to broker peace in Ukraine (Teh, 2022; Porter, 2023). On the other hand, Boris Johnson, the former Prime Minister and the leader of the Conservative Party, who has been supporting the Ukrainian defenders from the beginning, tried to convince Trump to support Ukraine, and the Italian leader Meloni, who leads a far-right party, is also willing to risk unpopularity to support Ukraine.(Amante, 2023) Poland, led by United Right, also has been supported Ukraine almost since day one and pleged a lot by its GDP size. The most interest part is that, the Trump supporters themselves were once considered more hawkish(Sides et al., 2018), but now they want world peace.\n\n\nResearch Question\nSo now we can see a very counter-intuitive problem: What is discouraging American conservatives from taking a more hawkish stance in support of Ukraine?\n\n\nHypothesis\nH1: Conservatives in the US are built differently. They hold different sets of beliefs than other conservatives, such as isolationism.(Clarke and Ricketts, 2017; Rolf, 2021; Cha, 2016; Clark et al., 2016)\nH2: They genuinely believe that supporting Ukraine will lead to WW3 or nuclear war, and they want to avoid that.\nH3: Their arguments are based on economics. Their perception of inflation leads to their war-weariness.\nH4: It is caused by polarization. They are only against what Biden supports. (Iyengar et al., 2019; Pierson and Schickler, 2020)\nH5: They are misled by Russian bots.(Stukal wt al., 2019; Gorwa and Guilbeault, 2020; Hagen et al., 2022)\nI must clarify that the research does not aim to test whether their arguments are true or not, but how these beliefs interact with conservative individuals’ attitudes toward supporting Ukraine.\n\n\nVariables Draft\nDV: Whether a comment supports Ukraine\nIV: The predicting factors in the said hypotheses\n\n\nData of Interest\nH1-H4: Youtube comments(tuber) H5: Twitter(kaggle)\n\n\nMethod of Interest\nText as Data H1-H4: Sentiment Analysis H5: Social Network\nFirst, I will use the Tuber package to extract Youtube comments from conservative media.\nThen I will process these comments and tokenize them to create a document by term matirx.\nAfter that, I will try some word frequency analysis or clustering to find out any features I may have ignored. If there are any, I will iterate my hypotheses.\nFinally, I will do sentiment analysis for the first four hypotheses, and maybe social network analysis for hypothesis five, because I need retweets to show the relationship between the Russian bots and the retweeters.\n\n\nBibliography\nCha, Taesuh. “The return of Jacksonianism: The international implications of the Trump phenomenon.” The Washington Quarterly 39.4 (2016): 83-97.\nClark, D.
