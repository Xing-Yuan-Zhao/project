### 1- BRIEF Book Summary:
#### Main research question:

Anomalies: 

1. Democracies are the top spender of defense budgets.

2. Democracies initiated more wars than before. 

Research question:

Why are democracies **pursuing more military conflicts**, but **achieving 
worse results**?

### 1- BRIEF Book Summary:
#### Main argument:

War by democracies are now a financial mobilization instead of a social mobilization

### 2- Critiques / Fixes:

1. Conceptualization problem: War vs Battle

fix: differentiate effectiveness in war and battle

---

#### (1)effectiveness difference between war and battle:

#### (2)factors impacting war outcome. i.e.: Audience cost

### 2- Critiques / Fixes:

2. Scope Limitation: 

The findings cannot be applied to conventional warfare, where technology and equipment are more decisive.

![](loss.png)

fix: incorporate more data

### 2- Critiques / Fixes:

3. Research design:

(1)Empirical evidence only proved some parts of the causal pathway.

(2)More evidence is needed for the internal mechanism.

(3)To establish causality, they may need more methods.

fix: time series analysis

### 2- Critiques / Fixes:

4. Case Selection: British Empire

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3- My Take:

#### Adjustments for the public opinion models:

Measurements: actually measure the cost of war for average voter (Fazal 2021)

Research Design:

1. Incorporate time series design to make stronger causal arguments
2. Incorporate spacial data test the cost of war using the difference between the states, such as enlistment rates

---

### 3- My Take:

#### Adjustments for the military aggression models:

Variables: 

DV: Differentiate war/battle and their effectiveness and outcome

Control variables: Types of wars

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4- Connections to Class Readings/Themes:

Lake(1992)

Democracies are:

Powerful Pacifists (X)

More invested in wars (✔)

---
  
### 4- Connections to Class Readings/Themes:

Tomz and Tweeks (2013)

Democratic leaders are beholden by voters for cost of war (✔)

which leads to democracies behaving peacefully (X)

<br>

Lyall (2010)

Democracies are not uniquely prone to losing counterinsurgency wars (X)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5- Implications and Relevant Event:

#### (1)Events that Can Potentially Be Explained by the book:

- Unconventional/asymmetrical wars:

- War on terror;

- France's interventions in Africa;

- Proxy wars during the cold war.

---

### 5- Implications and Relevant Event:

#### (2)Events that Cannot Be Explained by the book:

- Less Unconventional/asymmetrical wars:

- Russia-Ukraine War

<br>

#### (3)Events that Can Somewhat Be Explained by the book:

- Partial mobilization in Russia

---

### 5- Implications and Relevant Event:

#### (4)Real World / Policy Implications:

- For policy makers in developed democracies: War weariness can be reduced by avoiding the average voters' paying for it;

- For average voters: Not paying for it for now does not mean not paying for it forever; 

- For Military industrial complex: Populism is your friend;

- To promote peace: The vast majority must share the feelings of the war-torn people.
