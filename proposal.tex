\subsubsection{Topic of Interest and
motivations}\label{topic-of-interest-and-motivations}}

Conventional wisdom holds that right-wingers should be hawkish and are
supposed to tend to support a more aggressive foreign policy compared to
liberals, however, this does not seem to be the case for American
Republicans in the Russia's invasion of Ukraine scenario, according to
the following accounts. 19 GOP lawmakers urged Biden to stop sending
``unrestrained'' aid and weapons to Ukraine (The Hill. 2023), and Donald
Trump has also claimed to try to broker peace in Ukraine (Business
Insider. 2022; Business Insider. 2023). On the other hand, Boris
Johnson, the former Prime Minister and the leader of the Conservative
Party, who has been supporting the Ukrainian defenders from the
beginning, tried to convince Trump to support Ukraine(The Guardian.
2023), and the Italian leader Meloni, who leads a far-right party, is
also willing to risk unpopularity to support Ukraine.(Reuters. 2023)
Poland, led by United Right, also has been supported Ukraine almost
since day one and pleged a lot by its GDP size.(The Economist. 2022) The
most interest part is that, the Trump supporters themselves were once
considered more hawkish(Sides et al.~2018), but now they want world
peace.

\hypertarget{research-question}{%
\subsubsection{Research Question}\label{research-question}}

So now we can see a very counter-intuitive problem: \textbf{What is
discouraging American conservatives from taking a more hawkish stance in
support of Ukraine?}

\hypertarget{hypothesis}{%
\subsubsection{Hypothesis}\label{hypothesis}}

H1: Conservatives in the US are built differently. They hold different
sets of beliefs than other conservatives, such as isolationism.(Clarke
and Ricketts 2017; Rolf 2021; Cha 2016; Clark et al.~2016)

H2: They genuinely believe that supporting Ukraine will lead to WW3 or
nuclear war, and they want to avoid that.

H3: Their arguments are based on economics. Their perception of
inflation leads to their war-weariness.

H4: It is caused by polarization. They are only against what Biden
supports. (Iyengar et al.~2019; Pierson and Schickler 2020)

H5: They are misled by Russian bots.(Stukal wt al.~2019; Gorwa and
Guilbeault 2020; Hagen et al.~2022)

I must clarify that the research does not aim to test whether their
arguments are true or not, but how these beliefs interact with
conservative individuals' attitudes toward supporting Ukraine.

\subsubsection{Method of Interest}\label{method-of-interest}}

Text as Data H1-H4: Sentiment Analysis H5: Social Network

First, I will use the Tuber package to extract Youtube comments from
conservative media.

Then I will process these comments and tokenize them to create a
document by term matirx.

After that, I will try some word frequency analysis or clustering to
find out any features I may have ignored. If there are any, I will
iterate my hypotheses.

Finally, I will do sentiment analysis for the first four hypotheses, and
maybe social network analysis for hypothesis five, because I need
retweets to show the relationship between the Russian bots and the
retweeters.
